					<h3>Work experience</h3>
					<p>I have worked in the field of the state administration during the last five years but that came a bit boring and unsatisfying for me. I have also worked as an accountant.</p>
					<p>I have participated in a Work and Travel Program and I have worked as a store associate in the USA.</p>
